## Updates
"gh-pages" is the new "master"

### Questions

- Add questions to "slips.json", under the appropriate week header.
- The category headers are meant to be a resource, to help instructors that are creating the weekly groupings.  Their level of assistance is questionable (since they are not necessarily as up to date as the "week" groups are).

### Answers

- suggested answers are provided in "answers" dir. One file per week.

### Class rotation:

- Squad members are pulled from garnet using squad leader names.
  - Update squad leader names, in "index.html", via radio buttons under "#students_select".
