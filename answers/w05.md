  end
end

harry_potter = Student.new("Harry")

* Book table would include a library_id column (foreign key).

## What is the difference between an Active Record class and instance method? Provide an example of each.

## What is the difference between Active Record methods find, find_by and where? Provide an example of each.

* `find`: return an object with a particular ID.
  * `Student.find(2)`
* `find_by`: return the first object with a particular property.
  * `Student.find_by( name: "Karl" )`
* `where`: return all objects with a particular property.
